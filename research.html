  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>The following is a list of my current research interests.</p>
  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p></p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/crdt/2014/07/22/readings-in-crdts.html">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)</a>
      <p>Applications of CRDTs in distributed systems, specifically partitioned and replicated computation in large-scale systems.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="/distributed/systems/2013/07/12/readings-in-distributed-systems.html">Distributed Computing</a>
      <p>Efficient distributed computation in mobile and desktop applications supporting offline operation that preserve the correctness properties of applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://thinkdistributed.io">Education</a>
      <p>Instruction of distributed systems topics.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Research Projects</h2>
  <p></p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://syncfree.lip6.fr">SyncFree (EU/FP7)</a>
      <p>Large-scale on-line services including social networks and multiplayer games handle huge quantities of frequently changing shared data. Maintaining its consistency is relatively simple in a centralised cloud, but no longer possible due to increased scalability requirements. Instead, data must replicated across several distributed data centres, requiring new principled approaches to consistency that will be explored by the SyncFree project.</p>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://lasp-lang.org">Lasp</a>
      <p>Distributed deterministic dataflow programming using conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs).</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
