Research is difficult.  It is very difficult to know all of the possible work
that might be an influence that you were not aware of; it is literally
impossible to know every possible influential work that you have build you work
upon without spending hours upon hours working through citations on related
work.

In summary, I propose an alternative to “Hanlon’s Razor”:

“Never attribute to malice, that which is adequately explained by a
lack of exhaustive search to the researcher.”

We’re all human and we make mistakes whether we know it or not.  But, let us
all give each other a chance and never draw judgements without having a
conversation and know where we are coming from.
